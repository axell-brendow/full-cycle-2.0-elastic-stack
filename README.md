# full-cycle-2.0-elastic-stack

Files I produced during the "Observability / Elastic Stack" classes of the Full Cycle 2.0 [course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdN-qK_8Pfg6YI3TSfSa5_2-FHmqGxEP/view?usp=sharing)

## Initial steps

```sh
docker network create observability
docker-compose up
# Then, access localhost:5601 to open kibana
# Go to Observability->Metrics to see docker the metrics of your computer
# Go to Observability->Uptime to see the containers uptime
```
